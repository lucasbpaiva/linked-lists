# linked-lists

This repository features a fundamental implementation of the Singly Linked List data structure, developed as part of my journey in learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This project demonstrates my ability to implement and manage dynamic data structures in JavaScript using operations like insertion, deletion, and searching, offering a foundational showcase of algorithmic competence.

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

The `LinkedList` class implements a classic **Singly Linked List** structure.

###Core Structure

    * **Node Class:** A basic building block with two properties: val (the value stored) and next (a pointer to the next node).
    * **LinkedList Class:** Manages the list, primarily through the head pointer, which references the first node.
    
###Available Methods

| Method | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `append(value)` | adds a new node containing `value` to the end of the list |
| `prepend(value)` | adds a new node containing `value` to the start of the list |
| `size` | returns the total number of nodes in the list |
| `head` | returns the first node in the list |
| `tail` | returns the last node in the list |
| `at(index)` |  returns the node at the given `index` |
| `pop` | removes the last element from the list |
| `contains(value)` | returns true if the passed in value is in the list and otherwise returns false |
| `find(value)` | returns the index of the node containing value, or null if not found |
| `toString` | represents LinkedList object as a string in the format: `( value ) -> ( value ) -> ( value ) -> null` |
| `insertAt(value, index)` | inserts a new node with the provided `value` at the given `index` |
| `removeAt(index)` | removes the node at the given `index` |
